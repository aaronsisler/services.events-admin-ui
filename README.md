## Review or TODO Items in prioritized order

- Toast or something for when we save or do something
- How do we want the workflow for editing/updating Scheduled Events to be. I don't want to have to add and update one at a time.
- Figure out the Client | undefined issue...
- A way to trigger actions, such as logging in if the application wasn't ready yet
- Can you generate "models" from a contract?
- Testing... just all the testing. Playright? What test framework should we use...
- Getting a "Actions on Save" working such that the file and spacing/imports all format
- Should we use npm, yarn, pnpm, bun?
